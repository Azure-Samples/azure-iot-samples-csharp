# Azure IoT Samples for C# (.NET)

azure-iot-samples-csharp provides a set of easy-to-understand, continuously-tested samples for connecting to Azure IoT Hub via Azure/azure-iot-sdk-csharp.

These samples are against the `preview` releases of the Azure IoT Hub SDK for .NET. For samples against the GA releases, see [here](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/azure-iot-samples-csharp).

> NOTE: The `preview` branch is meant to hold only those samples that are relevant to the corresponding `preview` feature added in the SDK. Once the `preview` feature is GA'd, these samples will be moved over to the main branch. This branch is not intended to be directly merged into the main branch.

## Prerequisites

- .NET 5.0 on your development machine.  You can download the .NET 5.0 SDK for multiple platforms from [.NET](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/5.0).  You can verify the current version of .NET on your development machine using 'dotnet --version'.
